\chapter*{Preface}
Quantum mechanics describes physical systems by means of a state vector, $| \psi \rangle$. For systems extended in space a description of a portion of the system (located in some space region) cannot in general be given without taking into account all other constituents of the system (no matter how far these are). This is at the basis of the phenomenon of entanglement.

In 1935 Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Natan Rosen (EPR) realized that entanglement allowed a step further in the discussion on the foundations of quantum mechanics. In particular they showed that, under reasonable assumptions, $| \psi \rangle$ could not be regarded as a satisfactory description of single physical systems. Under these assumptions $| \psi \rangle$ could provide, at most, correct description of statistical ensembles of systems.

The next milestone in the discussion was the contribution by John S. Bell. In 1964 he showed that the premises on which the argument proposed by EPR rests lead to a contradiction of statistical predictions of quantum mechanics. Bell's argument is such as to allow an experimental test of quantum mechanical predictions against those descending from EPR's assumptions. Since the seventies a variety of such tests have been made with no one being able to disprove quantum mechanics.

This thesis will be concerned with some elements of this debate. In chapter \ref{chap:epr} we will present the EPR argument. Bell's reasoning will not be illustrated in favor of a more recent result on the same matter that Daniel M. Greenberg, Michael A. Horne and Anton Zeilinger (GHZ) proposed in 1989 (chapter \ref{chap:ghz-theorem}). Finally, chapter \ref{chap:ghz-experiments} will be concerned with some of the experimental efforts that have been made towards a test of quantum mechanics following the GHZ argument.
